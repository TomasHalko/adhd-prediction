# How to run?

Start with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can run the script alone with 
```
python3 ./ml_script.py
```

It will train on data from `Samlet_data.xlsx`, predict on data from `predict.xlsx` and save the results to `results.xlsx'.

You can also run jupyter notebook by running `ml.ipynb`.
